# Automation for IBM Security Verify Access [ISVA] with Ansible

This repository can be used in conjunction with the cookbook "ISVA Cookbook Ansible Automation Basics" (v0.0.20) to demonstrate the automation capabilities of the ISAM-Ansible-Collection (https://github.com/IBM-Security/isam-ansible-collection) leveraging the IBM-Security python package (https://github.com/IBM-Security/ibmsecurity) to automatically configure IBM Security Verify Access v10.0.0.0 (or previous versions known as IBM Security Access Manager [ISAM] v9.0.x).
